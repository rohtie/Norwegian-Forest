# Norwegian Forest

Demo made for a presentation in Tokyo.

I went out into the forest and created rubbings of trees, rocks, ground and leafs using charcoal on paper.
The rubbings are then used as a heightmap to create a virtual forest.

Made using my own demo tool: [Zypit](https://github.com/rohtie/Zypit)
